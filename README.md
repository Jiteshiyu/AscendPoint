## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/AscendPoint.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory.
   
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the landing page.

## Usage
- To view the landing page, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
- To customize the content:
  - Update the text and links in the HTML.
  - Replace the images located in the `/public` folder.
  - Modify the styles in the `style.css` file.
- The navigation bar is responsive, and the hamburger menu appears on smaller screens.
- The signup form is ready to accept user input but requires back-end integration for form submission.

## Future Improvements

- **SEO Optimization:** Improve SEO elements, including meta tags, structured data, and image alt attributes to enhance visibility.
- **Dynamic Content:** Introduce a content management system (CMS) or JavaScript for dynamic content loading.
- **Accessibility:** Enhance accessibility by adding ARIA labels and ensuring keyboard navigability throughout the website.
- **Animations & Transitions:** Add smooth animations to improve user engagement, such as subtle hover effects and section transitions.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Responsive Design:** Faced difficulties in creating a fluid and adaptive layout across multiple screen sizes. Learned advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid to ensure elements scale and align properly, improving responsiveness.
- **Form Validation:** Real-time form validation was complex due to the need for both security and user experience. Through this, I learned the importance of regular expressions and client-side validation to handle user input dynamically.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Addressed inconsistencies in how different browsers rendered the design. This process taught me the importance of testing on multiple browsers and applying fallbacks for compatibility.
